# Young Spotify Server

A simple express backend that handles Spotify Web API authentication for the frontend for security reasons. The client secrete has been removed in the repo.

The backend is hosted on Vercel as serverless functions, where the client secrete is stored as an enviroment variable.

For information about the app, please visit the repo for the [front end](https://github.com/syan6457/young-spotify).
